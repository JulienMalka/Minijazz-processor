=========

I've chosen to use Python for this project. It's a language I'm more familiar with that Ocaml.
This created an additional step as I had to write a lexer and a parser for the netlist language in Python.
That was an occasion for me to learn to use the ply library which is a port of yacc for Python.

#### Difficulties

I think that the project is not so difficult, but I lost a lot of time trying to understand some part of the documentation.
Some behaviours are sometimes not so clear, but understandable after a little bit of thinking, some are just not documented (ex : MUX).
Apart from that.
